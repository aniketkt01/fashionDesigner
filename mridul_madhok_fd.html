                Mridul had recently talked about his personal life in one of his YouTube
        videos. He shared the story of his past relationships where a girl
        cheated on him. The TikTok star is not dating anyone and he is more
        focused on his career. Speaking about his career, he started his TikTok
        career in 2019 and he has gained immense fan following. He has also
        attended Virat Kohliâ€™s marriage and met all the cricketers. An
        interesting point is that he was not invited for it but he somehow
        managed to sneak in, which he revealed in a YouTube video.
